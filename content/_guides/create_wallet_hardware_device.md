Make sure your hardware device is connected to your computer.

**Ledger**: Open the Monero app on your device.  
**Trezor**: Unlock the device.

If you are using Linux, make sure you have applied the appropriate udev rules to allow device access:

If the wizard isn't already open in Feather, go to **File â†’ New/Restore**.

In the wizard, select **Create wallet from hardware device**.

On the next page, **select the device type**. If your device isn't listed here, it is not (yet) supported. You can also find the list of supported devices, [here](hardware-wallet-support).

Select **Create new wallet file from device**, if:

- This is the first time you are setting up a Monero wallet from your hardware device, or
- The keys on the device hold no funds.

Select **Restore a wallet from device**, if

- You have previously sent/received Monero from/to the device.

If you selected **Restore wallet from device**, you will now be asked to enter the wallet [restore height](restore-height). If you don't know your restore height, enter the date you purchased the hardware device in the **Wallet creation date** field. A restore height will automatically be calculated from the entered date.

Proceed through the wizard by choosing a name for your wallet files and setting a password.
