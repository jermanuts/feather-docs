You can create multi-destination transactions by entering a list of outputs in the **Pay to** field. 

Specify one output per line. Outputs must be formatted: `address, amount`.

Example:

```
85BhQjVBJzUC1D2HPfxXpMCTnadBmTjVfXRwWnWXUnovK662U5SKj9GNgPovxYSJQZLFVGZ4G3trAUar1UAMhk2bDMMDfMP, 1

```

This transaction sends 1 XMR to the first address and 0.5 XMR to the second address.

The **Amount** field displays the total amount to be sent.

A maximum of 16 outputs may be specified. This is a limitation in the Monero protocol.
